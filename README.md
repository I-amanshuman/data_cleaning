# Data Cleaning using Pandas in Python

This is a mini project on cleaning up a dataset on Python using pandas, lambda functions, and string functions, based on the client's requirements. 


For all the Excel nerds (including myself), trying to clean up a large dataset, getting rid of unwanted characters, splitting columns, sorting the spreadsheet based on a particular range, arranging text in a particular format, etc, to make the data presentable, this comes as a fresh breeze.

Business Requirement:

Client is a call centre chain and they need their data cleaned in a format where they can simply use it to call their customers
Their entry sheet is manual and hence it contains a lot of noise.

Task:
Clean the data in a presentable format which can be referred to, for calling

Condition:
They do not want to disturb those customers who have opted not to call
