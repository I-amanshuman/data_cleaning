# Data Cleaning using Pandas in Python

This is a mini project on cleaning up a dataset on Python using pandas, lambda functions, and string functions, based on the client's requirements. 


For all the Excel nerds (including myself), trying to clean up a large dataset, getting rid of unwanted characters, splitting columns, sorting the spreadsheet based on a particular range, arranging text in a particular format, etc, to make the data presentable, this comes as a fresh breeze.
